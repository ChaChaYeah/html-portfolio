 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Gone in 60 Seconds</h3>
 <p>This is my favorite action movie. It stars Nicholus Cage and I used to always watch it with my grandfather.</p>
 <h3>RedLine</h3>
 <p>My favorite anime movie and one I watch every year on my birthday. The animation is gorgeous and every frame is completely hand drawn.</p>
 <h3>Step Borther</h3>
 <p>A comedy I can never get tired of and my go-to movie when I need a seratonin boost.</p>
